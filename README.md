# FNF: Sound Restored (EDGE Branch)

## What is FnF: Sound Restored?

This is a sound remaster project that aims to provide the definitive way to play base game before V-Slive with a few V-Slice extras already included in the Engine Were Currently Using which is Doido Engine:
[Doido Engine's Repository](https://github.com/DoidoTeam/FNF-Doido-Engine)

## Why Not Use Psych Engine or another engine?

the reason why this project doesnt use Psych Engine or other engines is because the modding community has been overrun by Psych Forks, and as much as i love codename, we havent really gotten a new Engine in awhile, this is one of the first ones in awhile that is actually new and not a psych engine fork

## Features

- repositioned and slightly tuned HUD
- Song Instrumentals and Vocals Remastered from the original Stems (Before V-Slice)
- Week 1-7 all ported and will be playable
- sound effect tweaks
- possibly more!

## the main goal of this project

the main plan for me with this project is too better understand Doido so i can use it for one off mods on my own and with friends in the future, my hopes are too make sure to use this as my little source playground and see what this engine is capable of as compared to other engines, this one is one i can actually read :3
