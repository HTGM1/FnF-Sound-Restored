# FNF: Sound Restored (Main Branch)

## Branch Info

EDGE is the bleeding edge Branch, changes are done almost as they are made, meaning alot of bugs and issues if you try to compile from these commits, as a example if im testing a stage the default stage may have changed and make week 1 a diffrent stage type thing

### everything involed with this branch is subjected to change, meaning the way some songs are EQed are not final as im always taking notes and feedback with playtesters!

## What is FnF: Sound Restored?

This is a sound remaster project that aims to provide the definitive way to play base game before V-Slice with a few V-Slice extras already included in the Engine Were Currently Using which is Doido Engine:
[Doido Engine's Repository](https://github.com/DoidoTeam/FNF-Doido-Engine)

## Why Not Use Psych Engine or another engine?

the reason why this project doesnt use Psych Engine or other engines is because the modding community has been overrun by Psych Forks, and as much as i love codename, we havent really gotten a new Engine in awhile, this is one of the first ones in awhile that is actually new and not a psych engine fork

## Features

- repositioned and slightly tuned HUD
- Song Instrumentals and Vocals Remastered from the original Stems (Before V-Slice)
- Week 1-7 all ported and will be playable
- sound effect tweaks
- possibly more!

## the main goal of this project

the main plan for me with this project is too better understand Doido so i can use it for one off mods on my own and with friends in the future, my hopes are too make sure to use this as my little source playground and see what this engine is capable of as compared to other engines, this one is one i can actually read :3
